A very powerful, craftable stick. Perfect to use while AFK.
Now with a craftable module variant.
(Be aware, you want a slower speed if your PC cannot handle terrain generation fast enough to not fall through the world)

Four types, four different speeds:

Super Stick 750: +750% Speed
Super Stick 1200: +1,200% Speed
Super Stick 2500: +2,500% Speed
Super Stick 7500: +7,500% Speed

All four have the same following stats:

50,000 Projectile Damage when thrown

Fall Damage Resistance: +250% (Armor still takes damage from the fall, based on height!)
Chance To Resist Sprain: +250%
Physical Damage Resistance: +250% (Armor still takes damage!)
Exposure Resistance: +250% (Armor still takes damage!)
Exposure Recovery Rate: +250%

Health Regen: +25000%

Food Consumption: -100%
Water Consumption: -100% (Depending on the biome, you can still become thirsty!)

NOW with craftable suit module variants!

Also, just for fun, Super Stick Animal Feed. Now you can give these same stats to your favorite mount!
(Warning! Duration of feed effect on mount lasts over 100 hours!)

I purposefully did not add player invincibility to the stick, that's boring!
