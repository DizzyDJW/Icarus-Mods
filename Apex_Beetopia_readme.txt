A huge overhaul for bees and bee-related things.

In order to obtain a sustainable source of bees, simply feed 50x Honey to a Worker Bee.
(Craft them together in a Chemistry Bench)

The resulting Gestating Bee will take some time to produce Royal Jelly.
(It spoils into Royal Jelly)

Feed the resulting Royal Jelly to a Queen Bee to obtain 5x Bee Eggs.
(Again, crafted in a Chemistry Bench)

After some time the bee eggs will hatch into more Queen Bees.
(They spoil into Queen Bees)

(It is NOT recommended to place Bees or Eggs into a Wood Composter in order to speed up the process. Do so at your own risk)
